### ü™õHardware Requirements

1. #### Arduino Nano:
   The Arduino Nano is a compact microcontroller board 

3. #### GSM module - SIM800L:
   The GSM module enables the smart blind stick 
   to have cellular connectivity. It allows for sending and receiving text 
   messages, which can be useful for communication or emergency situations.
 
4. #### LM2596 Step Down Converter:
   The LM2596 Step Down Converter is a 
   voltage regulator that converts a higher voltage (such as the 9V input) to a 
   lower, regulated voltage (such as 5V). It ensures that the components receive 
   a stable and appropriate power supply.
 
5. #### HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor:
   The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor uses 
   sound waves to detect obstacles and measure distances. It emits ultrasonic 
   pulses and measures the time it takes for the pulses to bounce back after 
   hitting an object. By calculating the time and speed of sound, it can estimate 
   the distance to the obstacle.

6. #### Water Sensor:
   The water sensor is used to detect the presence of water 
   or moisture. It can be helpful to alert the user in case of rain or wet surfaces 
   to ensure safety while navigating.

7. #### Push Button:
   A push button is a simple input device used for user 
   interaction. In the context of a smart blind stick, it can be used to trigger 
   specific actions or modes, such as activating or deactivating certain features.
 
8. #### Buzzer:
   The buzzer is an audio output device that produces sound alerts 
   or signals. It can be used to provide audible feedback or warnings to the 
   user, such as indicating obstacles.

9. #### BreadBoard:
   The Zero PCB is a prototyping board that provides a 
   convenient platform for soldering and interconnecting the various 
   components of the smart blind stick. It helps in organizing and mounting the 
   components securely.

10. #### 9V 2A Power Supply:
    The power supply provides electrical power to the 
    smart blind stick. In this case, a 9V power supply with a 2A (ampere) rating 
    is mentioned. It is important to ensure that the power supply can deliver 
    sufficient current to power all the components and maintain stable 
    operation.

By combining these components and programming the Arduino Nano using the 
Arduino IDE, you can build a smart blind stick that incorporates obstacle detection, 
cellular communication, and various alert mechanisms to assist the visually impaired 
individuals in their navigation.

### üíª Software Requirements

1. #### Arduino IDE:
     An open-source software platform used for programming Arduino boards. It provides an interface to write,
     compile, and upload code to Arduino microcontrollers. The Arduino IDE is designed to be user-friendly and 
     accessible for beginners, making it a popular choice for hobbyists, students, and professionals alike.
